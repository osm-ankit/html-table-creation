    <h5>Something about weed</h5>
    <p> <b><i>Marijuana, weed, pot, dope, grass.</i></b> There are different names for the same drug that comes from the cannabis plant. You can smoke it, vape it, drink it, or eat it. Most folks use marijuana for pleasure and recreation. But a growing number of doctors prescribe it for specific medical conditions and symptoms.Marijuana has mind-altering compounds that affect both your brain and body. It can be addictive, and it may be harmful to some peopleâ€™s health.<br>
       <h4> You can use marijuana in a variety of ways.</h4> 
        <ul>
       <li> Rolled cigarettes</li>
       <li> Small handheld pipes</li>
       <li>  Water pipes, called a bong</li>
       <li>A cigar that has been hollowed out and refilled with marijuana, called a blunt</li>
       <br>
        Sticky resins drawn from the cannabis plant. Resins often are loaded with much higher amounts of THC than regular marijuana
        You also can mix it into brownies, cookies, candy, tea, and other foods.<br> Eating and drinking the drug delay the high because it has to travel through your digestive system before the THC gets into your bloodstream. So it may take 30 minutes to 2 hours before you feel anything.<br> But edibles give you a high that lasts much longer -- up to 8 hours -- than if you smoke or vape weed.
